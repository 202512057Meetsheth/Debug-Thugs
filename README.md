🧩 Game Logic Overview

The snake grows when it eats a fruit.

Every few fruits, new obstacles appear.

The speed increases progressively as you level up or collect speed fruits.

Collision with walls, obstacles, or self results in Game Over.

Dynamic delay and adaptive difficulty are managed using a timing loop with std::chrono.

🧠 Technical Highlights

Fully object-oriented design (CyberSnake class encapsulates gameplay).

Uses ANSI escape codes for color, cursor control, and screen clearing.

Cross-platform keyboard input handling (conio.h on Windows, termios on Unix).

Real-time game loop using std::chrono::steady_clock.

Gradient color effects calculated dynamically with sine/cosine functions.
